** Program name: Shore impementation file
** Author: Daniel Shvarts
** Date: 03/19/2019
** Description: Derived from Space base class. Contains constructor to initialize the class with character and inventory objects to interact
** and modify them. Contains virtual menu function which will display options for user, scavengeSupplies method which will be used by player to
** gather resources, and finally a change location method, which enables user to change their location on the map
